# Stable Diffusion misc code
Miscellaneous code for Stable Diffusion stuff.

### Textual Inversion Colab Notebook
Modified primarily to allow for custom captioning; future modifications to allow for multiple learning rates and zipping up all the embed files after training is done.

Note that the Textual Inversion notebook is originally from Hugging Face here: https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/sd_textual_inversion_training.ipynb which is licensed under Apache 2.0. and originally copyrighted by them.
